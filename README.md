# Perceptron

Perceptron made with vanilla Javascript and graphical help of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## AI project of a Perceptron made with Javascript

This project was intended from the beginning to use Javascript knowing that languages like Python are better for this type of tasks.
My goal was to test my knowledge in javascript and make this simple IA project work on it.

I will try to making it better over time.
